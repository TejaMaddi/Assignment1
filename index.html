    <h1 class="h1">Overview of Web Development</h1>
    <p id="p1">Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.
        <br/>
        Web Development can be classified into two ways:
        <br/>1.Frontend Development <br/>2.Backend Development <br/>
        1.Web development is the process of creating websites that allow users to view and interact with content over the Internet. Web development includes many different aspects, including the creation of a website’s design and code to create a functioning website. In this blog post, we look at the importance of web development.
        <br/>
        2.Web is a critical part of bringing business ideas to life. In the 21st century, a solid web presence is essential for any business. This is because it gives potential customers a glimpse into the company’s culture and values, whilst also helping with branding and marketing. It also provides customers with a consistent experience across different platforms.

<br/>3.Web development is also important because it can help you stand out from competitors who aren’t as tech-savvy. If your website looks dated or unprofessional, customers may be turned off by your brand, even if they’re interested in your products or services.
<br/>4.Web development is important for creating more leads and sales because it makes it easy for customers to find your business online. If you don’t have a website, then people can’t find you when they go looking, and they’ll probably just go somewhere else. This can be especially problematic if you’re trying to reach out to a new demographic or appeal to a new market.<br/>    
5.Web development is a way of increasing traffic, engagement and conversion rates for a website because it can help you to create a site that is easy to navigate. This will help users to find what they’re looking for quickly, which can increase the likelihood that they will return to your site in future.

The more effective your web development is, the more likely it is that you will have positive interactions with your audience. This can encourage users to share content on social media and encourage others to be captivated by your content and subsequently visit your website.
